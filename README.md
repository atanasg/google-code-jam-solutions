# google-code-jam-solutions

Own solutions for the annual Google Code Jam competition. Visit https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam for more details. In April 2023 the last (farewell) rounds took place. 

_NOTE:_ The solutions are being pushed to this repository always after the end of the corresponding competition round. This should prevent any cheating attempts. The goal is rather to share knowledge and exchange algorithmic ideas.
